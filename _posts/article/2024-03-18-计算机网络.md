## OSI(Open ==Systems== Interconnection) seven-layer model

### basic English grammar and vocabulary

#### **vocabulary**
---
responsible `a.` 负责的，承担责任的
primarily `ad.` 首先，起初，原来
transmit `vt.` 传送，传达
facilitate `vt.` 促进，帮助
specify `vt.` 具体指定、详细说明 
involve `vt.`  使卷入、使连累
frequency `n.` 频繁，屡次
cable `n.` 电缆，钢索
#### **grammar**
---
responsible for  负有责任
for instants  例如
so that it can be adverbs upon verbs

### context
---
Physical Layer: Responsible for physically connecting two computers and transmitting binary data (0s and 1s) between them using high and low electrical frequencies, for example, through various types of cables to transmit bit streams.

**物理层**：负责把两台计算机连起来，然后在计算机之间通过高低电频来传送0,1这样的电信号，比如通过一些电缆线传输比特流。

--- 
Data Link Layer: The Data Link Layer involves various protocols such as MAC addresses and ARP. This layer is primarily responsible for facilitating communication between nodes, allowing them to communicate with each other. For instance, it uniquely identifies different nodes using MAC addresses and defines data packets through the Ethernet protocol.

**链路层**：链路层涉及到的协议比较多，比如 Mac 地址啊，ARP 等，这一层主要就是负责数据的通信，使各节点之间可以通信，比如通过 MAC 地址唯一识别不同的节点，通过以太网协议定义数据包等。

---
Network Layer: The Network Layer is responsible for transferring data from one network to another. Its primary function is to make routing decisions, using concepts such as IP and subnets, to facilitate the efficient transmission of data across different local area networks.

**网络层**：网络层负责把一个数据从一个网络传递到另外一个网络，最大的功能就是进行**路由决策**，比如通过 IP，子网等概念，使数据更好着在不同的局域网中传递。

---
Transport Layer: The Transport Layer is responsible for establishing end-to-end communication between ports. While the Network Layer focuses on establishing communication between hosts, the Transport Layer facilitates communication between specific programs running on those hosts. For example, while the Network Layer allows information to be transmitted from Host A to Host B, the specific program to which the information should be delivered on Host B is identified by protocols at the Transport Layer. Common protocols at this layer include UDP and TCP.

**传输层**：传输层的功能就是建立端口到端口的通信，刚才说的网络层的功能则是建立主机到主机的通信，比如通过网络层我们可以把信息从 A 主机传递到 B 主机，但是 B 主机有多个程序，我们具体要发给哪个程序，则是靠传输层的协议来识别，常见协议有 UDP 和 TCP。

---
Application Layer: Although we receive data from the Transport Layer, this data comes in various formats such as HTML and MP4, making it unreadable to users. Therefore, it is necessary to specify rules for the format of this data so that it can be interpreted and rendered properly upon receipt. For example, in the case of HTTP packets, the format of the data packet is specified.

**应用层**：虽然我们收到了传输层传来的数据，可是这些传过来的数据五花八门，有html格式的，有mp4格式的，各种各样，我们用户也看不懂，因此我们需要指定这些数据的格式规则，收到后才好解读渲染。例如我们最常见的 Http 数据包中，就会指定该数据包是 什么格式的文件了。

### context

the three-way handshake is a fundamental process in establishing a TCP connection, ensuring reliable and orderly communication between client and server. It helps to synchronize sequence numbers  and establish initial parameters for data transmission, contributing to the stability and security of network communication.
This process helps to ensure that both parties are ready to send and receive data effectively and reliably

三次握手是建立 TCP 连接的关键步骤，因为它允许客户端和服务器协商初始序列号，并交换通信所需的参数。这个过程有助于确保双方准备好有效可靠地发送和接收数据。
完成三次握手后，客户端和服务器都同步并准备好在建立的 TCP 连接上交换数据。这个过程有助于确保 TCP/IP 网络中通信过程的可靠性和完整性。

**First handshake**: The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, and specifying the initial sequence number (ISN) of the client as ISN(c),  indicating  its desire to establish a connection.
**Second handshake**: Upon receiving the SYN packet, To responses and acknowledges the  the server responds with a SYN+ACK(synchronize-acknowledge) packet. the server responds with its own SYN packet, specifying its own initial sequence number (ISN) as ISN(s). Additionally, it sets the ACK value to the client's ISN + 1, indicating that it has received the SYN packet from the client. At this point, the server is in SYN_RECEIVED state.
**Third handshake**: After receiving the SYN+ACK packet, the client need confirms the connection by sending a packet that replies with an ACK packet.
 the client sends an ACK packet, with the server's ISN + 1 as the ACK value, indicating that it has received the SYN packet from the server. At this point, the client is in the established state.
Once the server receives the ACK packet, the three-way handshake is completed and the server is in the established state.

**Dynamic ISN(Initial Sequence Number)** 
One important function of the three-way handshake is the exchange of ISN (Initial Sequence Number) between the client and the server, so that each party knows how to assemble data based on sequence numbers when receiving data.

If the ISN is fixed, attackers can easily guess subsequent acknowledgment numbers, so the ISN is dynamically generated.

三次握手的一个重要功能是客户端和服务端交换ISN(Initial Sequence Number), 以便让对方知道接下来接收数据的时候如何按序列号组装数据。

如果ISN是固定的，攻击者很容易猜出后续的确认号，因此 ISN 是动态生成的。

**half-open connection queue**
When the server receives the SYN packet from the client for the first time, it enters the SYN_RCVD state. At this point, the connection between the two parties has not been fully established yet. The server will place requests in this state into a queue, which we call the half-open connection queue. Of course, there is also a fully open connection queue, where connections that have completed the three-way handshake and been established are placed. If the queue is full, packet loss may occur. it just as same as the off-target situation.  
The paratrooper deviating from the intended landing point due to various reasons can be described as "drift" or "off-target."

服务器第一次收到客户端的 SYN 之后，就会处于 SYN_RCVD 状态，此时双方还没有完全建立其连接，服务器会把此种状态下请求连接放在一个队列里，我们把这种队列称之为**半连接队列**。当然还有一个**全连接队列**，就是已经完成三次握手，建立起连接的就会放在全连接队列中。如果队列满了就有可能会出现丢包现象。

To simulate the TCP connection process, We can implement it through Java's Socket programming.Sockets provide an abstraction layer between application services and TCP/IP communication. They encapsulate the complex communication logic of the TCP/IP protocol, allowing developers to work with a simplified interface. For me, I'm learning and understanding the TCP three-way handshake by writing a set of simple Java socket examples.

要模拟TCP的连接过程，可以通过Java的Socket编程实现;socket是基于应用服务与TCP/IP通信之间的一个抽象，他将TCP/IP协议里面复杂的通信逻辑进行分装，所以对于我来说，我是通过自己写一组简单的java socket案例来学习和了解TCP三次握手

Java sockets are full-duplex, meaning they can both receive and send data. However, if the input stream of the socket is closed, it can no longer receive data but can still send data.

After closing the socket's in or out stream, it's impossible to reopen it to continue sending or receiving data. Create new Socket can be synchronize data again.

It is important to notify the server that all data has been sent. If closed, the server will assume the client has terminated the connection, and the client will no longer be able to send or receive data through the current socket.

java 的socket是全双工的，也就是说，既可以接收数据，也可以发送数据，但是，如果关闭了socket的输入流，那么就不能再接收数据了，但是可以发送数据;需要注意的是 通知服务端，所有的数据已经发送完了 如果是close，服务端会认为客户端已经关闭了，同时客户端也不能通过当前的socket接收或者发送数据;socket 的输出流关闭后，就不能再使用了，只能创建新的socket使用。


## Four-way Handshake
### basic English grammar and vocabulary
#### vocabulary
---
initiate vt. 创始，入门
specify vt. 具体说明
acknowledge vt. 承认
transition n. 过渡
crucial a. 决定性的，重要的
duration n. 持续，连续 保持一定区间

### context

At the outset, both parties are in the "established" state. If it's the client that initiates the close request, then:

**First Wave**: The client sends a FIN packet, specifying a sequence number. At this point, the client enters the FIN_WAIT1 state. (In simpler terms: The client informs the server that it wants to disconnect.)

第一次挥手：客户端发送一个 FIN 报文，报文中会指定一个序列号。此时客户端处于FIN_WAIT1状态。（客户端告知服务器需要断开连接）

**Second Wave**: Upon receiving the FIN, the server sends an ACK packet, with the sequence number value of the client's packet plus one as the ACK packet's sequence number value. This indicates that the server has received the client's packet. At this point, the server enters the CLOSE_WAIT state. (In simpler terms: The server acknowledges the client's disconnection request.)

第二次挥手：服务端收到 FIN 之后，会发送 ACK 报文，且把客户端的序列号值 + 1 作为 ACK 报文的序列号值，表明已经收到客户端的报文了，此时服务端处于 CLOSE_WAIT状态。（服务器承认了客户端断开连接的请求）

**Third Wave**: If the server also wants to disconnect, it sends a FIN packet with its own sequence number. At this point, the server enters the LAST_ACK state.

第三次挥手：如果服务端也想断开连接了，和客户端的第一次挥手一样，发给 FIN 报文，且指定一个序列号。此时服务端处于 LAST_ACK 的状态。

**Fourth Wave**: Upon receiving the FIN, the client responds with an ACK packet, with the sequence number value of the server's packet plus one as the sequence number value of its own ACK packet. At this point, the client enters the TIME_WAIT state. It stays in this state for a while to ensure that the server receives its ACK packet before transitioning to the CLOSED state.

第四次挥手：客户端收到 FIN 之后，一样发送一个 ACK 报文作为应答，且把服务端的序列号值 + 1 作为自己 ACK 报文的序列号值，此时客户端处于 TIME_WAIT 状态。需要过一阵子以确保服务端收到自己的 ACK 报文之后才会进入 CLOSED 状态


**The Important Status : TIME_WAIT**
The TIME_WAIT state is crucial, occurring after the client sends an ACK packet but doesn't immediately close the connection. Instead, it waits for a period. This is because the client needs to ensure that the server has received its ACK packet. If the server hasn't received it, it will resend a FIN packet to the client. Upon receiving the FIN packet again, the client realizes that the previous ACK packet may have been lost and sends another ACK packet.

TIME_WAIT状态是非常重要的，它发生在客户端发送完ACK报文后，并不立即关闭连接，而是等待一段时间。这是因为客户端需要确保服务器已经收到了它的ACK报文。如果服务器没有收到，它会重新发送FIN报文给客户端。客户端再次接收到FIN报文后，意识到之前的ACK报文可能丢失了，于是再次发送ACK报文。

The duration of the TIME_WAIT state is at least one round-trip time. Typically, a timer is set, and if the FIN packet isn't received again within this time frame, it's assumed that the other party has successfully received the ACK packet. At this point, the connection enters the CLOSED state.

TIME_WAIT状态的持续时间至少等于一个往返时间。通常会设置一个计时器，如果超过了这个时间，没有再次收到FIN报文，那么就认为对方已经成功接收到了ACK报文，此时连接就处于CLOSED状态

**The main characteristics of the TCP protocol**

(1) TCP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol. This means that before data transmission can occur between two parties, a channel must be established. The process of establishing the channel involves a three-way handshake, while the process of terminating and destroying the channel involves a four-way handshake.

TCP是面向连接的运输层协议；所谓面向连接就是双方传输数据之前，必须先建立一条通道，例如三次握手就是建议通道的一个过程，而四次挥手则是结束销毁通道的一个其中过程。

(2) Each TCP connection can only have two endpoints (i.e., two sockets), making it a point-to-point protocol.

每一条TCP连接只能有两个端点（即两个套接字），只能是点对点的；

(3) TCP provides reliable transmission services. The data being transmitted is guaranteed to be error-free, not lost, not duplicated, and delivered in the correct order.

TCP提供可靠的传输服务。传送的数据无差错、不丢失、不重复、按序到达；

(4) TCP provides full-duplex communication. This means that both the sending and receiving applications can send data at any time. Each endpoint has its own send and receive buffers.

TCP提供全双工通信。允许通信双方的应用进程在任何时候都可以发送数据，因为两端都设有发送缓存和接受缓存；

(5) TCP is a byte-stream protocol. Although the application interacts with TCP using variable-sized data blocks, TCP treats the data as an unstructured stream of bytes. TCP does not guarantee a one-to-one correspondence between the data blocks received by the receiver and the data blocks sent by the sender. For example, if the sender's application hands over 10 data blocks to the sender's TCP, the receiver's TCP may deliver the received byte stream to the receiver's application using only 4 data blocks. However, the byte stream will be exactly the same.

面向字节流。虽然应用程序与TCP交互是一次一个大小不等的数据块，但TCP把这些数据看成一连串无结构的字节流，它不保证接收方收到的数据块和发送方发送的数据块具有对应大小关系，例如，发送方应用程序交给发送方的TCP10个数据块，但就受访的TCP可能只用了4个数据块久保收到的字节流交付给上层的应用程序，但字节流完全一样。

**The reliability of TCP**
  
The reliability of TCP is based on two main principles:
a. Error-free transmission channel, ensuring the correctness of transmitted data.
b. Regardless of how fast the sender transmits data, the receiver always has enough time to process the received data.

TCP的可靠性原理 可靠传输有如下两个特点: 
a.传输信道无差错,保证传输数据正确; 
b.不管发送方以多快的速度发送数据,接收方总是来得及处理收到的数据;

To achieve reliability, TCP employs the following strategies:

1. TCP establishes a reliable transmission channel using the three-way handshake to establish connections and the four-way handshake to release connections, ensuring the reliability of the established transmission channel.

2. TCP utilizes Continuous ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols such as Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat, along with sliding window protocols for flow control, to ensure the correctness of data transmission and enable the receiver to promptly process received data.

3. TCP implements congestion control mechanisms such as Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery to manage network congestion and prevent network congestion.

（1）首先，采用三次握手来建立TCP连接，四次挥手来释放TCP连接，从而保证建立的传输信道是可靠的。 
（2）其次，TCP采用了连续ARQ协议（回退N，Go-back-N；超时自动重传）来保证数据传输的正确性，使用滑动窗口协议来保证接方能够及时处理所接收到的数据，进行流量控制。 
（3）最后，TCP使用慢开始、拥塞避免、快重传和快恢复来进行拥塞控制，避免网络拥塞。


**The main characteristics of the TCP protocol**
1. UDP is a connectionless transport layer protocol.
2. UDP provides best-effort delivery, without guaranteeing reliable delivery.
3. UDP is message-oriented, preserving the boundaries of application-layer messages without combining or splitting them.
4. UDP does not include congestion control mechanisms, so it does not reduce its transmission rate even in the presence of network congestion.
5. UDP supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication patterns.
6. UDP has a small header overhead, consisting of only 8 bytes.

（１）UDP是无连接的传输层协议； 
（２）UDP使用尽最大努力交付，不保证可靠交付； 
（３）UDP是面向报文的，对应用层交下来的报文，不合并，不拆分，保留原报文的边界； 
（４）UDP没有拥塞控制，因此即使网络出现拥塞也不会降低发送速率；
（５）UDP支持一对一　一对多　多对多的交互通信； 
（６）UDP的首部开销小，只有８字节．
